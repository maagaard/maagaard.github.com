##Orange Dictionary##

The Orange Dictionary (Orange Ordbog in danish) is the latest project I've been working on. It is a dictionary with words connected to Roskilde Festival. 

Most of the words are submitted by users (guests of the Roskilde Festival) while the author SÃ¸ren Winther has come up with the rest. The submitted words have been thoroughly edited and altered by the author to match the intended tone of the dictionary. 


A few screenshots from the app can be seen below

I am very pleased with the result. 

Shout out to Kasper Munck @ KAPPS for design inspiration and implementation!
